Today we're going to be creating a simple login screen in React. 

We'll be learning about several key concepts/libraries:
- components, props & state, hooks, re-rendering
- Material UI
- React Router
- Redux
- Jest?


{ Repo has everything however the following are missing: 
- react hooks/state in Cats/Login
- Meat of redux (selectors, reducers, actions) 
- Cat route in navigation
- redux or nav code in cats/login
- some CSS for MaterialUI components (pick one that we can break out and restlye)
}

Components
- use XML instead of calling them as functions
- render phase vs reconsiliation phase
- class components vs function components
- smaller is better
{  }

[Transition - ]

MetialUI
- Pre-packaged HTML + CSS
- Quick, consistent
- Customizable with your own CSS (basic example)
- Themeable (basic example)
{  }

[Transition - ]

Components innards
- re-rendering
- props
- hooks & state
{  }

[Transition - lets say I want a change in this component to rerender another one though. Or maybe these components share some state]

Data organization
- Props
- Redux
- Context
{  }

[Transition - ]

React Router
- Basically a big context with extra bells and whistles
- updating browser stuff for you
- Can also handle stuff like loading screens, screen transitions, redirects, etc
